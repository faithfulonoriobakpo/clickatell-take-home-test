## Assumptions Made During Development
--------------------------------------

During development, the following assumptions were made:

* The application will be used to display a catalog of products.
* The products will be retrieved from a backend API
* The application will have basic filtering and sorting functionality.


## Areas for Improvement
-------------------------

Given more time, the following areas could be improved:

* **Product Details Page**: Create a separate page to display detailed information about each product.
* **Better Design**: Improve the application's design to ensure a better user experience.
* **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to handle cases where the backend API is unavailable or returns an error.
* **Unit Tests and End-to-End Tests**: Write unit tests and end-to-end tests to ensure the application's functionality and stability.
